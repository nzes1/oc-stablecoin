## üß† Why DSC Protocol?

> ‚Äú**Security first**, but without sacrificing usability.‚Äù

DSC‚Äôs **trusted fraction** model ensures that only the portion of collateral that can realistically be recovered in a downturn is counted toward your debt, acting as a built-in safety buffer.  
Check out the [Collateral Risk Parameters](./Collateral%20Mechanism/Config%20&%20Risk%20Parameters?collateral-parameters=RiskParams) for details.
