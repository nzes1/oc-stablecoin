    /**
     * @notice Executes the liquidation of an unhealthy vault by repaying its DSC debt and seizing collateral.
     * @dev This is the core liquidation function responsible for handling the mechanics of an undercollateralized
     * vault.
     * It can be called by anyone, but the caller must supply the vault's amount of DSC to repay the debt.
     *
     * If the vault was not previously marked as underwater, the function will first flag it and apply the more generous
     * liquidation reward parameters, providing greater incentive to the liquidator. These reward mechanics are defined
     * in the Liquidation contract and ensure that early liquidators receive a premium.
     *
     * The function processes the liquidation in the following order:
     * 1. Applies a liquidation penalty, deducted from the vault ownerâ€™s locked collateral.
     * 2. Calculates liquidation rewards for the liquidator based on the DSC repaid.
     * 3. Burns the DSC supplied by the liquidator and charges protocol fees (also deducted from the owner's
     * collateral).
     *
     * Liquidation outcomes fall into one of three categories:
     *
     * 1. Sufficient Collateral for Full Liquidation:
     *    The vault has enough collateral to cover both the base repayment (i.e., collateral equivalent of DSC debt)
     *    and the calculated liquidation rewards. The liquidator receives both in full.
     *
     * 2. Partial Rewards:
     *    The vault has enough to repay the base DSC-equivalent collateral but not the full rewards.
     *    The liquidator receives the base and as much of the rewards as available. If the remaining collateral
     *    is only sufficient for base repayment, then rewards may be zero.
     *
     * 3. Insufficient Collateral (Bad Debt):
     *    The vault doesn't have enough collateral to repay even the base amount. The liquidator receives no collateral.
     *    Instead, the DSC they repaid is refunded by minting new DSC from the protocol to cover their loss.
     *    The protocol absorbs the bad debt and takes ownership of the vault. Once governance is implemented, custom
     *    rules and resolutions can be introduced to handle absorbed bad debt positions.
     *
     * If the liquidator opts to withdraw (`withdraw = true`), their rewards are sent to their address.
     * If not, the seized collateral remains in the protocol, credited to their internal balance for future use.
     *
     * Any excess collateral left after repaying DSC and rewards is returned to the vault owner.
     *
     * @param collId The ID of the collateral token.
     * @param owner The address of the vault owner.
     * @param dscToRepay The amount of DSC the liquidator is repaying to initiate liquidation.
     * @param withdraw Whether the liquidator wants to immediately withdraw the received collateral from the protocol.
